This project is created by using MVVM-C pattern.

ViewControllers are responsible to interact with user in case of any input is required by the user for example selecting an item from the list.
ViewModels are responsible to create between ViewController and UseCases/Coordinators 
Coordinators are responsible to handle navigation and flow


Dependency Injection Containers are used in order to be able to Inject the ViewModels to ViewControllers
